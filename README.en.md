Lawver is a Chinese legal AI assistant project built by the GDUT legal intelligence team. It combines legal consultation, statute retrieval, case matching, company information lookup, contract/PDF/Word/TXT/Markdown document handling, conversation-level memory, and a frontend workspace into one application. The goal is not to return unverifiable one-line answers, but to structure legal questions into facts, authorities, retrieved evidence, and analysis paths that can be checked further.

The repository contains a FastAPI backend, a React/Vite frontend, a tool forwarding layer, legal data clients, document processors, a conversation memory system, and an output review flow. Module boundaries matter: business tools are exposed to agents through `mcps`, and product code should not bypass that middleware.

## Product Positioning

- A Chinese legal AI assistant prototype.
- Supports direct answer and Plan-and-Solve modes for different levels of task complexity.
- Connects agents to statutes, cases, company data, and document processors through tools.
- Keeps stable facts, user constraints, and working boundaries through conversation-level memory.
- Uses a frontend workspace to manage uploaded files, generated files, and conversation context.

## Capabilities

- **Legal and web retrieval**: exact statute lookup, natural-language statute search, source link confirmation, similar-case matching, and public web search through self-hosted SearXNG.
- **Company information**: company profile, listing information, contacts, shareholders, registration data, key personnel, and external investments.
- **Document processing**: PDF text extraction, sentence-level PDF annotation, Word reading, Word annotation writing, and safe TXT/Markdown read/write support.
- **Agent modes**: default answer and Plan-and-Solve workflows.
- **Moot court**: civil, administrative, and criminal trial simulations driven by a phase state machine, with four built-in roles (judge, opposing counsel, post-trial reviewer, optional user-side AI agent), fact/source boundaries between the public record and the private brief, and rewind/branch support.
- **Conversation workspace**: isolates `TEMP` and `Result` file spaces by user and conversation.
- **Conversation memory**: records and retrieves stable facts, goals, constraints, and semantic tags without stuffing all history into the prompt.
- **Auth and audit**: login, roles, admin account management, API access logs, Redis-backed shared rate limiting, and a session Bloom filter that absorbs invalid-token floods.
- **Frontend experience**: React 19 + Vite UI covering chat, moot court, file workspace, theme settings, admin dashboard, and Lawver branding.

Important paths:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agent.py` | Root shim that adds `backend/` to the path and creates the app; honors `PORT` and `UVICORN_WORKERS` |
| `backend/agent.py` | Pre-split entry moved under `backend/`; prefer the root shim for day-to-day starts |
| `backend/app_factory.py` | FastAPI application factory: middleware, routes, and lifespan tasks |
| `backend/routes/` | HTTP routes: auth, admin, chat, moot court, workspace, SPA fallback |
| `backend/services/` | Chat and court pipelines, history compression, memory coordination, law cache, workspace cleanup |
| `backend/agents/tool_loop.py` | Unified native tool_calls agent loop |
| `backend/tools/` | Explicit business tool registry (schema / handler / coercer / exposure) |
| `backend/mcps.py` | Unified business tool forwarding entrypoint |
| `backend/mcp/` | Legal, company, PDF, Word, TXT/Markdown, memory, and SearXNG clients |

| `frontend/src/` | React frontend covering main chat and moot court |
| `vite.config.ts` | Vite config: source root `frontend/`, build output root `dist/` |
| `tests/` | Coverage of memory, OCP, tool loop, moot court, security hardening, and more |
| `deploy/` | Production reverse-proxy and gateway examples |
| `infra/` | Shared infra still at repo root: auth store, password hashing, Redis / bloom filter |

### Directory migration map (old → new)

The repo is split into `backend/` (Python) and `frontend/` (React). If you still remember pre-split paths, use the rules below — **this section alone is enough to relocate files**.

**Three lookup rules:**

1. Former root-level backend Python packages/files → moved under `backend/` with the same relative path.  
   Example: `mcp/searxng_client.py` → `backend/mcp/searxng_client.py`; `services/chat_pipeline.py` → `backend/services/chat_pipeline.py`; original `agent.py` → `backend/agent.py`.
2. Former frontend `src/`, `public/`, and `index.html` → moved under `frontend/`.  
   Example: `src/hooks/useChat.ts` → `frontend/src/hooks/useChat.ts`; `public/sw.js` → `frontend/public/sw.js`.
3. These **stayed at the repository root** (not moved into backend/frontend): `infra/`, `RAG/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `deploy/`, `android/`, `assets/`, `data/`, `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `capacitor.config.ts`, `pyproject.toml`, `.env` / `.env_example`. In addition, a **new** root `agent.py` shim was added; use it for day-to-day starts and keep cwd at the repo root.

**Common path mapping:**

| Before (old) | After (new) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent.py` | `backend/agent.py` + new root `agent.py` | Original entry moved; root shim keeps `python agent.py` / `uvicorn agent:app` |
| `app_factory.py` | `backend/app_factory.py` | FastAPI application factory |
| `app_config.py` | `backend/app_config.py` | Reads `appConfig` from root `package.json` |
| `auth.py` / `hash.py` | `backend/auth.py` / `backend/hash.py` | Auth and password-hash CLI (`hash.py` needs `PYTHONPATH=.` at repo root) |
| `function_calling.py` | `backend/function_calling.py` | Model call wrapper |
| `prompt_loader.py` | `backend/prompt_loader.py` | Dynamic prompt assembly |
| `mcps.py` | `backend/mcps.py` | Tool forwarding entry |
| `schemas.py` | `backend/schemas.py` | Request models |
| `workspace.py` / `media.py` / `context_usage.py` / `ocp.py` / `output_sanitizer.py` | Same names under `backend/` | Workspace, media, context usage, output review / sanitize |
| `agents/` | `backend/agents/` | ToolLoop agent |
| `routes/` | `backend/routes/` | HTTP routes |
| `services/` | `backend/services/` | Chat / court / memory pipelines |
| `tools/` | `backend/tools/` | Tool registry |
| `mcp/` | `backend/mcp/` | Legal, company, PDF, Word, SearXNG clients |
| `llm/` | `backend/llm/` | Model clients |
| `memory_system/` | `backend/memory_system/` | Conversation memory |
| `prompts/` | `backend/prompts/` | Dynamic prompts (including `lawver/`) |
| `src/` | `frontend/src/` | React source |
| `public/` | `frontend/public/` | PWA / static assets |
| `index.html` | `frontend/index.html` | Vite HTML entry |
| `infra/` | `infra/` (root, unchanged) | Do not look under `backend/infra/` |
| `RAG/` | `RAG/` (root, unchanged) | Local statute DBs |
| `tests/` | `tests/` (root, unchanged) | Still run `python -m pytest` from repo root |
| `scripts/` / `docs/` / `deploy/` / `android/` / `assets/` | Same names at root | Not moved into backend/frontend |
| `vite.config.ts` | `vite.config.ts` (root) | `root` → `frontend/`, `outDir` still repo-root `dist/` |
| `dist/` | `dist/` (repo root) | Frontend build still emits to root `dist/` for the FastAPI SPA |

**Find by filename (from repo root):**

```bash
find backend frontend infra RAG -name 'searxng_client.py'
find frontend -name 'useChat.ts'
```

Always run `python agent.py`, `pnpm run build`, and `pnpm run dev` from the **repository root**. Do not `cd backend` before starting the app — that commonly causes `No module named 'infra'`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or newer.
- Node.js and pnpm.
- Android client builds require JDK 21 and the Android SDK.
- Access to the required model service and business data sources.
- A local `.env` file in the repository root for model API keys and local configuration.

Do not commit API keys, account credentials, or real client materials. Use `.env_example` as a starting point:

```env
API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The repository also includes `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. If your local workflow uses uv, install Python dependencies according to the team's convention.

## Development

Build the frontend assets:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Start the full application:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This runs `python agent.py`. To start only the Vite frontend development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev:frontend
```

Common scripts:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm run dev` | Start the FastAPI application |
| `pnpm run dev:frontend` | Start the frontend development server |
| `pnpm run build` | Build the frontend |
| `pnpm run preview` | Preview the frontend build |
| `pnpm run lint` | Run TypeScript checks |
| `pnpm run clean` | Remove frontend build output |
| `pnpm run mobile:doctor` | Check the Capacitor Android environment |
| `pnpm run mobile:android:sync` | Build the frontend and sync Android assets |
| `pnpm run mobile:android:test` | Run Android debug unit tests |
| `pnpm run mobile:android:apk` | Build the Android debug APK |

## Android APK Releases and Updates

Production Android releases are built by the GitHub Actions `vX.Y.Z` tag workflow. The workflow checks that the tag matches `package.json.version`, signs the release APK with the long-lived release keystore from GitHub Secrets, and uploads `Lawver-${version}.apk` plus `android-version.json` to the GitHub Release.

On startup, the production backend syncs the latest Android release from GitHub into the local cache directory, defaulting to `data/releases/android/`, and exposes unauthenticated read-only distribution endpoints:

- `GET /api/releases/android/latest`: returns the cached version metadata and rewrites `apkUrl` to the production backend download URL.
- `GET /api/releases/android/apk`: downloads the cached APK and applies a per-IP default limit of 6 RPM.

Optional environment variables:

- `LAWVER_RELEASE_SYNC_ON_STARTUP`: sync GitHub Release on startup, default `1`.
- `LAWVER_RELEASE_REPO`: GitHub Release source repository, default `Hill-1024/Lawyance`.
- `LAWVER_RELEASE_DIR`: APK cache directory, default `data/releases/android/`.
- `LAWVER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: public production base URL. Falls back to package.json `appConfig.domain` (currently `https://cn.lawver.dev`).
- `LAWVER_APK_DOWNLOAD_RPM`: per-IP RPM limit for APK downloads, default `6`.
- `LAWVER_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`: additional trusted reverse-proxy CIDRs. By default only loopback is trusted; only trusted sources may supply `CF-Connecting-IP` / `X-Forwarded-For` for logs and rate limits.
- `LAWVER_GITHUB_TOKEN`: read-only token for private repositories or GitHub API rate limits.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

The current suite has roughly 440 cases. Representative coverage:

- `tests/test_memory_system.py`, `tests/test_prompt_loader.py`: conversation memory and dynamic prompt assembly.
- `tests/test_ocp.py`, `tests/test_tool_loop_agent.py`: output review and the unified tool loop.
- `tests/test_court_mode.py`: moot-court phase state machine and role boundaries.
- `tests/test_security_hardening.py`, `tests/test_mcps_workspace_paths.py`, `tests/test_remaining_vulnerability_fixes.py`: CSRF, rate limiting, workspace paths, and regression coverage for past vulnerabilities.
- `tests/test_request_shielding.py`: Bloom-filter false-negative boundaries, shared rate limiting, Redis degradation, and database-free rejection of invalid tokens. The Redis branch needs `fakeredis` (see `requirements-dev.txt`) and skips automatically without it.
- `tests/test_function_calling_tools.py`, `tests/test_tool_schema_compatibility.py`, `tests/test_tool_exposure.py`: tool schemas, exposure tags, and OpenAI compatibility.
- `tests/test_law_data_search.py`, `tests/test_law_cache_startup.py`, `tests/test_searxng_tool.py`: local law retrieval, incremental cache build, and the SearXNG client.

## Backend Topology and Tool Registry

`agent.py` only preserves the `agent:app` import contract and `python agent.py` entrypoint. Application assembly lives in `backend/app_factory.py`; HTTP routes live in `backend/routes/`; chat pipeline, history compression, memory coordination, and cleanup jobs live in `backend/services/`.

Route registration order must remain: auth → admin → chat → moot court → APK release distribution → workspace/upload/download → SPA catch-all. `backend/routes/spa.py` must be registered last so `/api/*` is never swallowed by the frontend fallback.

Business tools still reach agents through `backend/mcps.py`. To add a tool:

1. Implement the real client or handler under `backend/mcp/`.
2. Register its schema, handler, coercer, and `exposure` explicitly in `backend/tools/__init__.py`.
3. Call it through `mcps.use_tools()`; agents, routes, and services should not bypass `mcps`.

`exposure` is the single source of truth for tool visibility:

- `agent`: visible in the main LLM tool schema.
- `plan_and_solve`: visible in Plan-and-Solve mode, including business tools and control-plane tools.
- `court`: visible to the moot-court pipeline (`registry.schemas("court")`), covering legal sources, company data, document handling, web search, memory, and workspace tools.
- `ocp_reviewer`: read-only legal source tools available to OCP.
- `internal`: backend-dispatchable tools that are hidden from the LLM tool schema.

Workspace path validation lives in `backend/workspace.py`, shared by `backend/mcps.py` and `backend/tools/*`, so registry modules never need to import back from `mcps`.

OCP is a post-answer formatting review pass. Main-model failures still follow the main-model error path; OCP timeout, network failure, tool failure, or reviewer failure must not raise into the user path. It falls back to deterministic sanitizer-only output while preserving the main-model answer.

This architecture work does not include Lawver naming cleanup, tool naming rewrites, or agent reasoning strategy rewrites.

### Call Chain and Decoupling Invariants

Every request is accepted and forwarded through exactly two routers; cross-module direct calls are forbidden:

```text
backend/routes/  ->  backend/services/  ->  backend/services/agent_builder.py (paradigm router)
                                 |-- execute_tool  = mcps.use_tools(..., capability)
                                 |-- output_review = services/ocp_service.build_output_review(...)
                                          |
                                          v injected
                             agents/ToolLoopAgent (single agent loop, only calls injected handlers)
                                          |
                                          v
                             backend/mcps.py (the only capability router)
                                 |-- tools/registry.py
                                 |-- mcp/* · memory_system/ · RAG/
```

Invariants are locked by `tests/test_architecture_boundaries.py`:

- Only `backend/mcps.py` and `backend/tools/**` may import `tools` / `tools.registry`.
- `backend/agents/**` must not import `ocp`, `services/**`, `tools`, `mcp`, `memory_system`, or `RAG`.
- `backend/tools/**` must not import `services/**`.
- `backend/services/**` and `backend/routes/**` must not import `tools`, `mcp`, `memory_system`, `RAG`, or `ocp` directly; everything goes through `mcps`. Only `services/ocp_service.py` may construct `ocp`.
- The production import graph must be acyclic.
- Neutral shared modules (`backend/workspace.py`, `backend/media.py`, `backend/context_usage.py`, root `infra/`) must not depend back on `services/`.

OCP follows the same shape as default / plan_and_solve / court: `services/agent_builder.py` resolves it into an `output_review` injected into `ToolLoopAgent`, and the agent loop never imports `ocp` itself. Known exception: model-profile reads for the main model and OCP (`function_calling` / `services.ocp_service` → `services.settings_service`) remain a config-store dependency; it does not depend back on its callers and forms no cycle.

The web-search tool uses self-hosted SearXNG and does not depend on third-party search APIs such as Tavily or SerpAPI. `web_search` only returns structured results and snippets; when full page text is needed, the model should call `web_fetch`. `web_fetch` marks returned page text as untrusted web data and it must not be followed as instructions.

TXT/Markdown files are handled by `txt_md_reader` / `txt_md_writer` within the current conversation workspace. Reads and writes filter executable Markdown/HTML embeds such as `<script>`, event-handler attributes, and `javascript:` / `data:` links.

Optional environment variables:

- `SEARXNG_BASE_URL`: SearXNG instance URL, default `https://serp.mutsumi.moe/`
- `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` / `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`: Cloudflare Access Service Auth headers; the older `SEARXNG_CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` / `SEARXNG_CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` names remain supported
- `SEARXNG_ENGINES`, `SEARXNG_CATEGORIES`, `SEARXNG_LANGUAGE`, `SEARXNG_SAFE_SEARCH`: default search parameter overrides; normally let server-side `settings.yml` and `categories` route engines, and set `SEARXNG_ENGINES` only when exact engines must be pinned
- `SEARXNG_TIMEOUT`, `SEARXNG_MAX_RESULTS`, `SEARXNG_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`: request and result size limits; defaults are 20 seconds and 10 results

## Conversation Memory and RAG Weights

The memory system remains conversation-level structured memory. Retrieval fuses multiple signals: lexical matches, semantic tags, entities, recency, priority, and active focus. When optional embedding retrieval is enabled, vector similarity is added as one `embedding` signal in the same RAG-weighted ranker instead of replacing the existing multi-route retrieval.

Optional environment variables:

- `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_ENABLED=1`: enable embedding as a retrieval weight, disabled by default
- `EMBEDDING_API_KEY`: API key for the embedding service
- `EMBEDDING_BASE_URL`: OpenAI-compatible embedding base URL, default `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1`
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL`: embedding model, default `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`
- `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_TIMEOUT`: embedding request timeout, default 8 seconds

## Moot Court

The moot-court workflow simulates a trial driven by multiple AI roles. It shares the workspace and tool registry with the main chat but runs through its own prompts and pipeline.

- **Three case types**: civil, administrative, and criminal. Each is driven by a phase state machine (opening → claim/prosecution statement → court inquiry → evidence cross-examination or legality review → court debate → final statement → judge summary → post-trial review).
- **Per-role memory isolation**: judge, opposing counsel, post-trial reviewer, and the optional user-side AI agent each own a private memory scope; only the public speech goes into the shared transcript.
- **Fact and source boundary**: speakers may only ground statements on the shared dossier, the public transcript, and tool results. Unverified facts must be marked as such; opposing counsel may raise plausible hypothetical facts, but only with hedging language.
- **Rewind and branch**: revert the session to any prior public event (recomputing structured state and wiping AI-side private memory), or fork a new court session from that point that inherits the dossier but evolves independently.

Backend entrypoint: `routes/court.py`; pipeline: `services/court_pipeline.py` and `services/court_fsm.py`; frontend: `src/components/CourtPage.tsx` and `src/hooks/useCourtSession.ts`.

## Development Boundaries

- `backend/mcps.py` is the unified business-facing tool entry point for agents. New tools should be implemented in `backend/mcp/` clients and exposed through `mcps`, instead of being called directly by agents or API routes.
- The memory system is conversation-level structured memory. It is not user-level profiling; optional embedding is only a retrieval weight signal.
- Uploaded and generated files must stay inside the user/conversation workspace boundary.
- Legal answers should preserve a verifiable chain: facts, statutes, cases, or source links should remain traceable.
- Frontend migration and UI work should follow the Lawver design system, not hide layout issues with padding hacks or compatibility layers.

## Accounts and Permissions

Accounts, password hashes, and online sessions live in the SQLite database `auth.sqlite3` under `data/`, alongside `secrets.json`, `settings.json`, and `lockout.json`, instead of `data/account.json`. On first start, if the auth database is empty and a legacy `account.json` exists, it is imported and the file is renamed to `account.json.imported-<timestamp>` (role `admin` maps to `sudo`). Day-to-day password resets should go through the admin UI under System Administration → All Accounts; editing the database by hand is usually unnecessary.

### CLI password-hash tool (`backend/hash.py`)

After the monorepo split, application code lives under `backend/`, while `infra/` (including `password_hashing`) remains at the **repository root**. `backend/hash.py` only adds `backend/` to `sys.path`, so running it from inside `backend/`, or invoking the script path alone, produces:

```text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'infra'
```

Run it from the **repository root** and put the root on the module search path:

```bash
cd /path/to/Lawyance
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python backend/hash.py
```

Do not use `cd backend && python hash.py`, and do not run `python backend/hash.py` without `PYTHONPATH=.`. The root entrypoint `python agent.py` is unaffected: it starts at the repo root, so it can import root-level `infra/` and also adds `backend/` to the path.

There are three roles, forming a `sudo → admin → user` hierarchy:

- `sudo`: full permissions — view usage logs, manage every account, set each admin's quota n / m, override a user's online-device limit, kick any device, and manage system/model settings. The built-in account is named `admin` with role `sudo` and cannot be deleted.
- `admin`: manages only the users it created, up to n accounts; can reset passwords, delete, and kick their devices. Cannot create admins/sudos, cannot change m, and cannot see logs or system settings.
- `user`: use only.

Online device limit: each account is capped by its "max online devices" value (blank/0 means unlimited). A login creates a session record; sessions active within `LAWVER_ONLINE_WINDOW_SECONDS` (default 900) count as online. When the cap is exceeded the oldest idle device is kicked by default (`LAWVER_ONLINE_LIMIT_ACTION=reject` refuses the new login instead). Logout, password/role changes, and deletion revoke the affected sessions immediately.

## Request Shielding (Rate Limits and Bloom Filter)

Two front-line defenses keep large volumes of invalid requests from punching through to the backend. Both degrade automatically with Redis availability.

**1. Shared rate limiting.** Every `/api` request is counted per client IP (100/minute by default), and `POST /api/login` has a stricter login bucket (30/minute by default). The login bucket exists to stop same-IP credential stuffing across many usernames, which per-account lockout cannot catch. Android APK downloads use the same counter (6/minute by default, tunable with `LAWVER_APK_DOWNLOAD_RPM`). A blocked request returns 429 with `Retry-After`, before the request body is read.

**2. Session Bloom filter.** The JWT `sid` is checked against a bitmap first; a token whose `sid` is definitely absent is rejected without opening SQLite. The bitmap is add-only and only participates once warm-up finished and both the bitmap and its ready marker exist: evicted keys, interrupted warm-up, or command errors all fall through to the database. False negatives (rejecting a valid login) therefore cannot happen, and a false positive only costs one extra lookup.

With Redis configured, rate-limit counters and the session bitmap are shared by every worker/instance; without `LAWVER_REDIS_URL` everything falls back to process-local state, matching the previous single-worker behavior. Redis is only a shield: a wrong URL, an unreachable server, or a failing command degrades for a cooldown window without affecting login or authentication. Plain Redis is enough — no RedisBloom module is needed, since the bitmap uses `SETBIT`/`GETBIT`.

Optional environment variables:

- `LAWVER_REDIS_URL` (also accepts `REDIS_URL`): Redis connection string, e.g. `redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0`; unset means fully process-local.
- `LAWVER_REDIS_PREFIX`: key prefix, default `lawver`.
- `LAWVER_REDIS_TIMEOUT`: per-command timeout in seconds, default `0.25`; a stalled Redis adds at most this much latency per request.
- `LAWVER_API_RATE_LIMIT`: global per-IP API requests per minute, default `100`.
- `LAWVER_LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT`: per-IP login attempts per minute, default `30`.
- `LAWVER_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`: set to `0` to disable rate limiting entirely (test environments only).
- `LAWVER_BLOOM_ENABLED`: set to `0` to disable the session Bloom filter and query the database on every request.
- `LAWVER_BLOOM_SESSION_CAPACITY`: bitmap capacity, default `200000`; size it to the order of magnitude of live sessions.
- `LAWVER_BLOOM_ERROR_RATE`: false-positive rate, default `0.001`.

Startup logs report the backend actually in use: `Redis 请求防护：available=... prefix=...` and `会话布隆过滤器预热完成：...`.

## Region Path Routing

One build can be served under several gateway path prefixes, with the gateway routing `/cn`, `/asean`, and so on to their regional backends (for example `lawver.dev/cn` and `lawver.dev/asean`). The prefix list lives in `package.json` under `appConfig.regions`; the build references assets by relative path, and the runtime prefix comes from the `<base>` injected by the gateway.

**The gateway must inject `<base href="/cn/">` statically.** Assets are referenced relatively (`./assets/...`) and resolved against `<base>`, which has to be a static tag in the HTML stream. Inserting it from a script at runtime runs after the browser's preload scanner: the scanner resolves `./assets/...` against the prefix directory without its trailing slash (`/cn` becomes `/`), requests `/assets/...`, and those hit the default route — so an `/asean` page loads assets from the `cn` region. See [docs/cloudflare-worker-router.js](docs/cloudflare-worker-router.js) for the working example.

From that prefix the app derives four behaviors with no extra configuration: the router `basename` (so `/cn/settings` matches `/settings`), all API paths (`prefix + /api/...`), the service worker registration and scope, and the PWA manifest paths — each stays inside its own region.

If the gateway injects no `<base>`, the app falls back to `appConfig.regions` so the SPA still renders, but assets go to the default region and the console reports a warning.

## Security Notes

- `.env`, real contracts, client materials, generated results, and logs may contain sensitive information and should not be committed casually.
- First deployment must set `SECRET_KEY` with at least 32 random characters and a one-time `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`; remove the initial password variable after the auth database is created.
- Origin control (CORS / Origin checks) is not implemented in the app; configure it at the gateway layer (reverse proxy / CDN). The app keeps rate limiting, JSON body limits, and access logging.
- By default, `CF-Connecting-IP` / `X-Forwarded-For` are honored only from loopback proxies. Add production proxy ranges with `LAWVER_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` when the proxy is not local.
- Rate-limit counters and the session Bloom filter are process-local by default. Multi-worker (`UVICORN_WORKERS>1`) or multi-instance deployments should set `LAWVER_REDIS_URL`; otherwise each worker counts on its own and the real ceiling is multiplied by the worker count.
- Admin APIs manage accounts and read logs: `/api/admin/logs` is sudo-only, while account and device endpoints are scoped by the sudo/admin hierarchy. Expose them only to trusted staff.
- File annotation, document reading, and download APIs require ongoing attention to path isolation and permissions.
